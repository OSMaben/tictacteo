# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete on a larger 20x20 grid. The game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it features a dynamic grid, score tracking, and customizable player names.

## Features

- **20x20 Grid**: Unlike the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe, this game uses a 20x20 grid, offering a more challenging and strategic gameplay experience.
- **Player Tracking**: Players can enter their names, which are saved in local storage.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the scores of each player across sessions using local storage.
- **Turn Indicator**: Displays whose turn it is during the game.
- **Win Detection**: Detects wins across rows, columns, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Open the game in a web browser. The grid size is set to 20x20, providing a larger playing area for the players.
2. **Players**: The game is designed for two players. Enter player names when prompted, or continue as "Player 1" and "Player 2".
3. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns clicking on the empty cells in the grid. Player 1 will always be "X", and Player 2 will be "O".
4. **Winning**: The first player to align their symbols (X or O) in a continuous line of the required number (adjustable, e.g., 5 in a row) wins the game. A message will be displayed declaring the winner.
5. **Score Updates**: Scores are automatically updated and stored in local storage.
